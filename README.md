I did this challenge to help me better understand JavaScript. This challenge also helped me with thired party API's and how they work. Doing this challenge helped me better understand how to format JavaScript to get the results I wanted.

Then add the weather API you are using for the weather.
Format your HTMl, CSS, and JS.

Used to see the weather up to five days from the current day in a city.
